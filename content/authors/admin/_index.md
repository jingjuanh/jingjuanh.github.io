  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m Jingjuan Huang, born and raised in China, currently in my first year of PhD.

My academic interests focus on unlocking the potential of data. With research experience in social science and financial simulation optimization, I have built strong foundations in mathematics, statistics, and programming. Advanced tools like large language models are particularly exciting for their potential to enhance productivity and address real-world challenges.

Outside of academics, socializing and sharing meals with friends are some of my favorite activities. Sports have also been a meaningful part of my life, with awards earned in sprinting, rock climbing, rowing, and table tennis.
